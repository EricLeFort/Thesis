\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Project Overview}
The core of this project involves developing a tool utilizing machine learning which can predict the number of enrolling students given an admission average or the admission average given a target number of enrolling students. Furthermore, developing this system will involve designing, constructing, and populating a database of relevant historic and current data.

\subsection{Product Perspective}
This section will outline various interfacing requirements as well as memory constraints of the system. Furthermore, it is important to note that this is intended as an improvement or extension of an existing project previously made by AdvOL.
\subsubsection{System Interfaces}
This system will require a user-level GUI which provides tools to perform predictions. This web interface will be designed to be compatible with both desktop and mobile devices.
\subsubsection{Software Interfaces}
This system must interface internally with its database of applicants. Furthermore, it will also need to interface with libraries which provide machine learning algorithms.
\subsubsection{Memory Constraints}%TODO define
UNKNOWN - TO BE DETERMINED


\subsection{Description of Operation}
This section will describe both normal operation and how the system will handle unexpected events.
\subsubsection{Normal Operation}
Normal operation will consist of two main phases. The first phase will be training a new prediction model based on past data. This phase will occur as soon as the final data for the previous year is available. During this time, if an old model exists, the user can still access it but should be provided a visual warning that a new model is being trained. During the training phase, the system must first parse the applicant data provided by the university in order to store it in the database. Once it is in the database, the learning algorithm will use that data and available past data to train the system. The most recent year's data will remain for testing and as a control. As testing completes, the system will log the current model's accuracy for future reference.\\~\\
The second phase will consist of using the trained model to predict results for the coming year. This will involve taking in either the target quantity of offers accepted or the minimum average desired and returning the expected value of the opposite parameter as determined by the trained model.
\subsubsection{Error Handling}
The main source of error in this project will arise while training the prediction model. If the prediction model is not able to converge to within its acceptable margin of error, this error should be logged in detail and a developer must work to modify the learning algorithm as necessary. The same type of process should be followed if the dimensionality reduction algorithm is unable to successfully reduce the dataset to within a reasonable feature count.\\~\\
Another source of error will be due to the format of new data. This is an issue since this application has no control over the format of the data it is provided. In the case of an error of this nature, the error should be logged and a notification should be sent out to the developer indicating that they should check the error logs.\\~\\
In the case of either type of error, a warning should be shown on the GUI to make the user aware that the new data has not been added or that the model might not be accurate.

\section{Project Drivers}
\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}
The purpose of this project is to predict the amount of individuals that will accept an offer of enrolment from McMaster University in the faculty of engineering given an admission average or the admission average given a number of enrolling students. This tool will greatly assist the Dean's office in deciding what the minimum required grade average for candidates should be.
\subsection{Clients, Customers, and Other Stakeholders}
The client for this project is the Dean of Engineering, Dr. Ishwar Puri, and Assistant Dean, Maria White, for the faculty of engineering at McMaster University.\\~\\
Future customers will include the admission departments for the rest of McMaster University.\\~\\
Stakeholders of this project include the faculty of engineering and the department of admissions at McMaster University as well as the IRA, AdvOL, and applicants to the programs hosted by McMaster University.



\section{Project Constraints}
These are the constraints that are necessary for the operation and development of this program:
\begin{itemize}
	\item All identifying data must remain confidential and protected.
	\item The application cycle must be adhered to.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Scope}
The scope of this project will currently only take into account students entering either the co-op or non-co-op engineering programs. Further prediction models would have to be introduced in order to support other programs as well. The only data used will be that which is provided to AdvOL by the university (i.e. the team will not work on gathering its own  data).
\subsection{Relevant Facts \& Assumptions}
This section will outline various facts and assumptions that will be leveraged in the design of this system.
\subsubsection{Facts}
\begin{itemize}
	\item[-] The format of data of previous years.
	\item[-] There will be unknowable underlying data that is important to an applicant's final choice.
	\item[-] This model will not account for factors such as political, environmental, or personal influences.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item[-] Future data formats will not deviate that far from past formats.
	\item[-] Rates of grade inflation will be predictable.
	\item[-] Recent applicants are more similar to current applicants than less recent ones.%Am I actually assuming this though?
\end{itemize}



\section{Requirements}
The following section outlines the various requirements of this system. For each requirement, a description of the requirement, the rationale behind the requirement, and a fit criterion for when the requirement will be satisfied are provided. The values given for customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction are from 0-5. The values for requirement priority are either high, medium or low. All high priority requirements are necessary for the system to be functional. Failing to meet too many medium priority requirements may result in considering the system unsatisfactory. Low priority requirements would be nice to have but are not mission critical.
